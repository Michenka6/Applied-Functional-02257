---------------------------------------------------

Restrictions (that are not imposed by the grammar): 

* In some arithmetic module op[src1, src2, dst] we must have dst != src1 and dst!= src2
also we say that the operands are species. Output species must be different than input
species.

* Multiple instructions that do not conflict with each other can be part of same step and 
they are executed in parallel. Conflict?
	Conflict: 
	Cyclic dependencies, output of one operation input of other operation.
	Example: 
		Step[{ mul[a, b, c], add[c, d, a] }]
	Is NOT allowed since output of add is input to mul and output of mul input to add.
	Same as when we have input species = output species, cycle of length 1


* In examples it looks as if lists (command list and root list) are surrounded by "{" "}". 
Not mentioned in grammar...

* Also not mentioned in grammar but in programs: End program with ";". some do some do not

* After calling cmp in a step a user can use intructions ifGT ... in subsequent steps - the flags 
are active until the next call to the cmp module. So probably also these flags can not be used in 
same step as cmp operation. The dependency thing. 

* To use conditionals we must have done a comparison in a previous step. 

* Should we allow spaces between for instance add and [] add[ or also add [. Just pick one. looks weird maybe

* According to grammar ConcS may follow a StepS... ok but annoying to implement

* Load and cycles.... Cmp and cycles ---> both operands to dst set and should be different.

* Can same species be dst multiple times? No harm but then not deterministic because ordering within steps 
does not matter according to specification?

* Four flags in total? not X_gt X_lt for every variable x. But two flags like this corresponding to 
operands of cmp. Or for each variable? Or just two but no then how eq.

* Initial state is the one obtained after running all concs? 

* Source operands must be declared before being used but not destination operands, can appear
"dynamically"

* For now we assume that Conc statements may not follow Step statements.
    So that program consits of two parts: first Concs, then Steps.
